## Project Brief

**Bibo YouTube Video Generator** — an automated CLI pipeline that transforms YouTube videos into new content:

1. **Transcription** → Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (long-running, GCS for large files)
2. **Summarization** → Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`) → 900-word documentary script
3. **Text-to-Speech** → Google Cloud TTS (Studio voices) → `2_audio.mp3`
4. **Image Prompting** → Gemini → `3_image_prompts.json`
5. **Image Generation** → Vertex AI Imagen → `5_images/`
6. **Metadata Generation** → Gemini → `4_metadata.json`
7. **Video Composition** → MoviePy 2.x → `6_final_video.mp4`

### Stack
- **All Google Cloud/Gemini** (no OpenAI/Anthropic)
- File-based state in `projects/<name>/`
- CLI menu in `main.py` with pipeline status display
- Unit tests (mocked) + integration tests (real API)

### Recent Work (Feb 1–4)
- Migrated transcription from OpenAI Whisper → Google STT
- Migrated TTS from OpenAI → Google Cloud TTS
- Migrated summarization from Anthropic → Gemini
- Added GCS upload for large audio (always-GCS for long-running recognition)
- Increased timeout to 60 min for long videos
- Built full CLI pipeline menu with status display
- Added logging (`src/logger.py`)
- Created docs: README, SETUP, ARCHITECTURE, API

### Status as of Feb 4
✅ End-to-end pipeline complete and working  
✅ All unit tests passing  
✅ ~38% cheaper than OpenAI/Anthropic stack

### Pending (from Feb 4 notes)
- [ ] Progress bars for long operations
- [ ] Retry logic for transient API failures
- [ ] Video preview/thumbnail generation
- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Parallel image generation
