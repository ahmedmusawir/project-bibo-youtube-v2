# Windsurf Working Agreement

## Session log requirement

At the start of each new working session, create a session log file in the repository root using this filename format:

`session-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

- Keep this file as a running progress log for the session.
- Update it after meaningful events, including:
  - Code changes
  - Decisions made
  - Bugs found/fixed
  - Lessons learned
  - Next steps / TODOs

## What to record

Each update should include enough context to continue the work later without relying on chat history.

Recommended structure:

- Timestamp (optional)
- What changed (files/areas touched)
- Why (intent/decision)
- Result (what works/what doesn’t)
- Next steps
